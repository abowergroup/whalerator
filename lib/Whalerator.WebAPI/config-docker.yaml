# Basic config for running standalone in a Docker container
# Use this as a starting point for a production deployment

# Configure caching options. By default, Whalerator will use an in-memory cache. An external Redis cache will greatly increase
# performance and scalability in production use. 'layercache' is the only absolutely required configuration option, as Whalerator
# needs somewhere to download image layers.
cache:
  # StackExchange.Redis connection string.
  #redis: localhost
  # Local folder for storing downloaded layer data
  layercache: /var/data
  # Cache lifetime (in seconds) for volatile data (tags, repository list, etc). Default is 900 (15 mintues).
  #volatileTtl: 3600 # 1 hour
  # Cache lifetime for non-volatile data (hashed layers, manifests, etc). Default is null (keep indefinitely).

# each list may have multiple filenames specified, separated by semicolons. Only the first hit from each list will be displayed. Names are case-insensitive
